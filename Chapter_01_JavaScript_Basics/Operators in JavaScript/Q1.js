**Q:** Write a program to take two numbers and print:

* Their sum
* Their difference
* Their product
* Their quotient
* Their remainder

ðŸ“¥ Example Input: `a = 15`, `b = 4`

ðŸ“¤ Example Output:
Sum: 19
Difference: 11
Product: 60
Quotient: 3.75
Remainder: 3
*/

// SOLUTION

let a = 15;
let b = 4;

console.log("Sum:", a + b);
console.log("Difference:", a - b);
console.log("Product:", a * b);
console.log("Quotient:", a / b);
console.log("Remainder:", a % b);
